# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch-Logistic-Regression-Decision-Tree

There are two Jupyter Notebook files 

The dataset file is in the folder named "data".

In both the .ipynb files, write the path to the .csv file in the "data" folder in the starting itself and execute the code to get the results as mentioned below

1)Data generation (Part 1A- minmax scaling) and Logistic Regression (basic and scikit learn) has been performed and the results have been generated. 
	Just execute the lines of code and all the scores(accuracy, precision and recall) for Part 2 will be visible  


2) Data generation (Part 1B - Z-score normalization) and Decision tree (basic and scikit learn) has been performed and the results have been generated.
	Just execute the lines of code and all the scores(accuracy, precision and recall) for Part 3 will be visible

# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch

Run codes as per the given instructions :

The file submitted is a Jupyter Notebook File (.ipynb)

1. Understanding the data and simple curve fitting

i.  Keep the training and test data in the destination file of Jupyter Notebook
ii. Run the "ML_Asgn-1_(1).ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook running through each cell
iii.See the plot of training and test dataset in the Notebook and the test error at the end of the notebook
iv. Results are also listed in the word file "ML_Asgn-1_(2).docx".

2. Visualization of the fitted curves

i.  The curves for train/test error for different values of n were plotted in (1) and have been presented in the word file "ML_Asgn-1_(2).docx"
ii. Squared error curve drawn at the end of the file "ML_Asgn-1_(1).ipynb" 

3. Regularization

i.  Run the file "ML_Asgn-1_(3_Lasso).ipynb" to see the Lasso regularization for n=2 and n=9
ii. Run the file "ML_Asgn-1_(3_Ridge).ipynb" to see the Ridge regularization for n=2 and n=9
iii.Plots for regularization have been plotted in the above respective files and results mentioned in the word file "ML_Asgn-1_(3).docx"

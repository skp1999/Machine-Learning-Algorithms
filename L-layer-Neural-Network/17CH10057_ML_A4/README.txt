The folder "17CH10057_ML_A4.zip" contains the following structure - 
	1 - 'data' folder
		i. seeds_dataset.txt
	2 - 'src' folder
		i. Part-1.py 
		ii. Part-2.py

Part-1.py contains the code for an L-layer neural network from scratch with object oriented approach and can be used in general for specifications mentioned in Part-1A and Part-1B.

Part-2.py contains the implementation of l-layer neural network using Scikit Learn for specifications mentioned in Part-1A and part-1B.
